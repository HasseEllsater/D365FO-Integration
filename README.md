# D365FO-Integration

In this repository I want to share tools for D365FO developers. My first project here is a simple test tool to test Custom services in D365FO using JSON. Feel free to download and contribute. The UI is based on MahApps.Metro and ControlzEx components, all components used is available via nuget.

The communication part of the tool is based on the samples provided by Microsoft. The UI is based on a hamburger menu sample from punker76, see the amazing code samples here https://github.com/punker76/code-samples.

The solution also consist of a setup program that let you easily distribute the app within your project, endpoints, services and id and keys can be added to simplify for the users that's testing your API.

To be able to load the setup program in Visual Studio the Extension "Microsoft Visual Studio Installer Project" must be installed first.
